        <p><em>Database Administrator Team Lead at <strong><a href="https://www.kurtosys.com/">Kurtosys</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I have been a Database Administrator since 2007 with humble beginnings on MSSQL 7.0 and MSSQL 2000. Those were the days :)
          <br>Solving problems and finding concise solutions have been a passion of mine since day one. I have a passion to get to know the technologies I worked with in great detail. This has not been limited to DBMS but every aspect of the stack
          that I work with. This has given me an immense opportunity to become truly multi-skilled as well as agnostic to the database technology vendor.
          <br>Looking to the future I am building out my skill set to be able to lead and assist other Data specialists to become high performers in their respective spaces.
